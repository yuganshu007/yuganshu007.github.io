Highlights from the first cohort:

- Right-sized streaming choices across Kinesis, Kafka, and Pub/Sub for three different founding teams.
- Helped design multi-region failover runbooks with chaos experiments baked into sprint rituals.
- Delivered cost-to-value forecasts that saved startups an estimated 28% in infra spend.

The clinic will run quarterly with new focus tracks on applied ML and reliability.
