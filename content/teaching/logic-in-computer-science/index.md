As Head Graduate TA, I coordinate the Logic in Computer Science course (CSE 215) for 120+ students. My focus:

## Instruction Design

- Built a _proof automation harness_ with Python + Lean that validates student proofs, pinpoints counterexamples, and recommends remediation paths.
- Refactored weekly recitations into **mission-based labs** that map logic tools to security policies, distributed consensus, and ML verification.
- Authored a modular note series (<https://logic-builder.xyz>) so students can remix lessons into study plans.

## Team Leadership

- Run weekly pedagogy standups, aligning 12 TAs on rubrics, grading heuristics, and student sentiment.
- Pair mentors with at-risk students using early-warning metrics from Gradescope + feedback forms.
- Introduced reflection loops after major assessments to continuously improve course delivery.

## Tooling

- CI pipelines that run latex-to-PDF conversions, release annotated slides, and push solution walkthroughs.
- Slack bots that surface anonymized Q&A trends directly to instructors for quick interventions.

Result: course satisfaction up 18% YoY, and average proof competency scores rose by 12 percentage points.
