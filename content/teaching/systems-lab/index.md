This lab pairs student teams and startup founders to bring real workloads into the classroom. Each cohort ships a reliability upgrade with measurable impact.

## Weekly Rhythm

1. **Architecture review** — map current-state diagrams, risk registers, and failure domains.
2. **Chaos drills** — inject faults via Litmus, k6, or custom scripts; observe with OpenTelemetry.
3. **Fix it sprint** — propose remediations, quantify cost vs. resilience, and implement guardrails.
4. **Demo day** — teams present SLO dashboards, runbooks, and before/after metrics.

## Highlights

- Guided a ridesharing startup through multi-region failover with <100ms RPO.
- Tuned Kafka retention + compaction for a fintech client, slashing storage spend by 32% while keeping recovery objectives intact.
- Built a reusable playbook for instrumenting ML inference services with red/black releases.

Students leave with production-grade checklists they can reuse in internships and full-time roles.
